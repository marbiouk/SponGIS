SponGIS Database
==========================

The SponGIS site and database has been designed to hold data pertaining or related to deep-sea sponges from around the world. The database is based on established Biodiversity Data Standards and has been purposely built to mirror the OBIS Schema, with some SponGIS specific extensions. This allows simple contribution of our data to a much larger and well used dataset, fulfilling our data archiving obligations for the SponGES project.

####The SponGIS Submission Template - See Folder SponGIS_Template
Written in Microsoft Excel, the SponGIS submission template has been designed to make it simple to translate existing or build new datasets that can be entered into SponGIS. The template contains several sheets, and has full explanation of each field in the database. You do not have to do anything else except fill in the template, SponGIS staff will convert the dataset (when accepted) into the required formats for archiving.
